# 3D Engine
This is a project consistent of creating a Game Engine,
that allows you to use tools to create video games.
At this moment, this is a Geometry Loader, where you can import your model (.fbx, etc.)
and see info about it. Also you can change/apply textures to the different meshes
that composes the entire model (only .png or .jpg formats).

# FEATURES
- Configuration options (App, Window, Audio, Render).
- Game Objects Structure (with components).
- Basic GameObject Creation (Cube, Sphere).
- Main Camera (Frustum geometry).
- Game Clock (Play, Pause & Play Frame Modes).
- Model importation (Imports meshes and textures, and creates Game Objects with correct components).

# CAMERA CONTROLS(is Like Unity)
- Right Mouse Button: look around with static position
- Left Mouse Button + L-Alt: orbit around a selected object.
- Mouse Wheel: Zoom in / Zoom out.
- Middle Mouse Button: drag and move the camera vertically and horitzontally.
- F: center the Camera on the selected object.

# MODEL/TEXTURES IMPORTING
To import a model (.fbx/.obj) to the Engine, just drag it inside the window.
It will create a resource to access its information and operate with it internally.

	* Add Modules -> Importer and Loader
		> Import and Load Meshes.
		> Import Textures.
	* Add ModuleFs.
	* GameObject & Components Structure:
		> Components: transform, mesh, material and camera.
	*Hierarchy and Inspector Windows work on Game Objects structure.
- 0.5:
	* Implemented diference movement Camera (Now is Like Unity).
	* Add more modules in Configuration Window
	* We can set different textures on each different mesh of the model (if imported correctly).
	* Color of the model can be edited.
